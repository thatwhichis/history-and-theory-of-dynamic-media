## Creative Project 1: Fluxus Score

### Mock Interview

For performance by three (3) people with four (4) Zoom enabled video/audio devices with four (4) Zoom accounts.

The three (3) participants will discuss necessary materials and decide who will take each role (one (1) role per participant).

Roles:
1. [Technical Difficulties (TD)](./technical_difficulties.html) - Requires two (2) Zoom enabled devices with two (2) Zoom accounts.
2. [Recruiter (R)](./recruiter.html) - Requires one (1) Zoom enabled device and one (1) Zoom account.
3. [Candidate (C)](./candidate.html) - Requires one (1) Zoom enabled device and one (1) Zoom account.

Once roles are decided, each participant should open the link to their role and proceed from there.

(**NOTE:** For demonstration purposes, this score may be performed in a single Zoom meeting via two breakout rooms, rather than two individual Zoom meetings, so long as one room contains both (R) and one (TD) account, and the other room contains both (C) and the other (TD) account. Any spectators in either room should ensure their audio is muted/disabled.)
