## Creative Project 1: Fluxus Score

## Technical Difficulties (TD)

Requires two Zoom enabled devices with two Zoom accounts.

# Pre-Interview

- (TD) Sets up two Zoom enabled devices, each signed into a different Zoom account, facing each other and within audible range of each other so that the screens can be mutually seen and audio mutually heard.
- (TD) Creates a Zoom meeting on each device from a separate account and provides different links to join to Recruiter(R)/Candidate(C).
- (TD) Starts audio and video on both devices.
- (TD) Admits (R) and (C) to separate meetings that are now audible/visible to each other.
- (TD) Chooses a three-to-five-minute duration to allow the interview to continue; when the selected duration has elapsed, network disruption ends the interview prematurely.

# Interview

- (TD) May, and is somewhat encouraged, to interact with interview process indirectly.
