## Creative Project 1: Fluxus Score

## Technical Difficulties (TD)

Requires two Zoom enabled devices with two Zoom accounts.

### Pre-Interview

- (TD) Set up two Zoom enabled devices, each signed into a different Zoom account, facing each other and within audible range of each other so that the screens can be mutually seen and audio mutually heard.
- (TD) Create a Zoom meeting on each device from a separate account and provides different links to join to Recruiter(R)/Candidate(C). 
  - (**NOTE:** For demonstration purposes, (TD) accounts may be assigned into two separate Zoom breakout rooms.)
- (TD) Ensure audio and video are enabled for both devices.
- (TD) Admit (R) and (C) to separate meetings that are now audible/visible to each other.
  - (**NOTE:** For demonstration purposes in two separate breakout rooms, (TD) pins (C) and (R) to their respective room. Any spectators should ensure their audio is muted/disabled.)
- (TD) Choose a three-to-five-minute (3 - 5 minute) duration to allow the interview to continue; when the selected duration has elapsed, end the interview as a demonstration of network disruption.

### Interview

- (TD) Indirectly interact with interview process.
  - [Suggested Interactions](./technical_difficulties_suggestions.html) (Open in new tab/window.)
- At the end of the previously selected three-to-five-minute (3 - 5 minute) duration, end the interview as the final Technical Difficulty.

### Post-Interview
- Consider the effects of technology on this interview for between twenty-four (24) and forty-eight (48) hours.
- At the end of a twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48) hour period, ask (R) and (C) individually to describe how (TD) impacted this interview experience.
- Write down in a journal some of the worst case scenarios technology could introduce in real interviews.
- Next time (TD) schedules an interview for a position (whether as (R) or (C)) (TD) reads over journal entry for this score and reflects upon the experience.
