## Technical Difficulties (TD)

Requires two Zoom enabled devices with two Zoom accounts.

### Pre-Interview

- (TD) Sets up two Zoom enabled devices, each signed into a different Zoom account, facing each other and within audible range of each other so that the screens can be mutually seen and audio mutually heard.
- (TD) Creates a Zoom meeting on each device from a separate account and provides different links to join to Recruiter(R)/Candidate(C). (NOTE: For demonstration purposes, this step may be done with two breakout rooms from a single Zoom meeting.)
- (TD) Starts audio and video on both devices.
- (TD) Admits (R) and (C) to separate meetings that are now audible/visible to each other.
- (TD) Chooses a three-to-five-minute duration to allow the interview to continue; when the selected duration has elapsed, network disruption ends the interview prematurely.

### Interview

- (TD) May, and is somewhat encouraged, to interact with interview process indirectly.
- [Suggested Interactions](./technical_difficulties_suggestions.html) (Open in new tab/window.)
- At the end of the previously selected three-to-five-minute duration, end the interview (due to "Technical Difficulties").

### Post-Interview
- Consider the effects of technology on this interview for between twenty-four (24) and forty-eight (48) hours.
- At the end of a twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48) hour period, ask (R) and (C) individually to describe how (TD) impaced this interview experience.
