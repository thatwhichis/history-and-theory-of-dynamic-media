## Creative Project 1: Fluxus Score

## Technical Difficulties

Requires two Zoom enabled devices with two Zoom accounts.

- TD Sets up two Zoom enabled devices each signed into a different Zoom account facing each other and within audible range of each other so that the screens can be mutually seen, and audio mutually heard.
- TD Creates a Zoom meeting on each device from a separate account and provides different links to join to Interviewer/Interviewee.
- TD Starts audio and video on both devices.
- TD Admits Interviewer and Interviewee to separate meetings that are now audible/visible to each other.
- TD Chooses a three-to-five-minute duration to allow the interview to continue; when the selected duration has elapsed, network disruption ends the interview prematurely.
- TD May interact with interview process indirectly.
